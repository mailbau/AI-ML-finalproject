## Results

The results of the analysis are as follows:

1. **Comparison of Regression Tree Method (Before vs. After Augmentation and Feature Selection):**
   - Paired t-test: t-value = -1.512, p-value = 0.205
   - Conclusion: The p-value (0.205) is greater than the significance level of 0.05. Therefore, we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. There is no significant difference in accuracy between the regression tree method before and after applying data augmentation and feature selection.

2. **Comparison of Polynomial Regression Method (Before vs. After Augmentation and Feature Selection):**
   - Paired t-test: t-value = -1.166, p-value = 0.308
   - Conclusion: The p-value (0.308) is greater than the significance level of 0.05. Hence, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no statistically significant difference in accuracy between the polynomial regression method before and after data augmentation and feature selection.

3. **Comparison of XGBoost Method (Before vs. After Augmentation and Feature Selection):**
   - Paired t-test: t-value = 0.597, p-value = 0.5832
   - Conclusion: The p-value (0.5832) is higher than the significance level. Therefore, we cannot reject the null hypothesis. There is no significant difference in accuracy observed between the XGBoost method before and after applying data augmentation and feature selection.

4. **Comparison of Classifiers (After Augmentation and Feature Selection):**
   - Null hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in accuracy between the classifiers after combining data augmentation and feature selection.
   - Alternate hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in accuracy between the classifiers after combining data augmentation and feature selection.
   - ANOVA: F-value = 573.68, p-value = 0.999
   - Conclusion: The p-value (0.999) is much larger than the significance level of 0.05. Therefore, we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Based on the statistical analysis, we cannot conclude that there is a significant difference between the classifiers after combining data augmentation and feature selection.
  
## Conclusion

In conclusion, our project highlights the importance of data augmentation and feature selection in addressing data scarcity issues. Although these techniques did not lead to significant improvements in performance individually or when comparing the methods, they provided valuable insights into feature relevance and ensured robustness of the models. The findings emphasize the need for carefully selecting appropriate modeling techniques and indicate that the original methods, along with data augmentation and feature selection, can effectively predict white wine quality.
